# ruby-api-rubs
Auto-generated stubs for the SketchUp Ruby API. Useful for IDE intellisense and auto-complete.

This is currently a work in progress and it may change a lot in the near future.

The stubs are automatically generated by a YARD template which we will publish in our sketchup-yard-template repository: https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-yard-template

Please don't make pull-requests to this repository - all content beside this README is automatically re-generated.

Guidance on how to set up editors to use the stubs will come.
